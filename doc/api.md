The examples need the following packages:

    pip install requests

An example of using the external authentication API is shown in
`doc/examples/external_authentication.py` and can be tried out
if spire is running:

    python external_authentication.py localhost:8000

or against the live app:

    python external_authentication.py https://cloudfleet.herokuapp.com/auth/
